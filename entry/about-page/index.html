        <p>CAN YOU FEEL ME is a harmonic collection of human experiences designed to evoke a profound sense of “sonder.” Sonder is the realization that every individual has a life as vivid and complex as one’s own, where they are the protagonist and others, including oneself, play supporting or peripheral roles.</p>
        <p>In the modern age, as technology has become ubiquitous, it has become increasingly common to walk through the world with headphones on, often disconnected from our surroundings. This phenomenon is especially evident in cities like New York, where public transportation and walking are integral to daily life. Every day, we pass by thousands of people, yet we rarely acknowledge their existence, perceiving them as mere background figures in our narrative.</p>
        <p>CAN YOU FEEL ME seeks to break this cycle by showcasing individuals from diverse backgrounds and their emotional triggers—happiness, sadness, and anger—three universal emotions that connect us all. Visitors to the site can explore these stories and respond to prompts, fostering a deeper sense of empathy and connection with strangers. By engaging with these narratives, visitors not only experience sonder but also contribute to it. The individuals whose stories are shared receive responses that highlight shared emotions, bridging the gap between disconnected lives and creating a reciprocal sense of understanding.</p>
        <p>Additionally, CAN YOU FEEL ME provides a dedicated space for visitors to reflect and reconnect with themselves. This interactive area offers a chance to pause, decompress, and appreciate both their inner world and the lives unfolding around them.</p>
        <p>This project is conceived and created by <a href="https://instagram.com/dxxidlee/" target="_blank" class="underline">David Lee</a> under the guidance of Zach Scheinfeld for Core 1: Interaction at Parsons School of Design.</p>
        <p>CAN YOU FEEL ME invites you to step outside your own narrative and truly feel the richness of others’ lives, as well as your own.</p>
